## An article, written in Politico by Daniel Panneton ,on the Rosary has gotten the Catholic world's attention.  The author writes that the rosary has become “a symbol of violent extremism.”  This ambiguous statement has caused nothing but controversy by those who pray it and those who know nothing about it.  Perhaps people who haven't heard of it can be informed of the history of the Rosary.  Also, it was to be said that the Rosary was received by the founder of the Dominican order, Saint Dominic , from the blessed Virgin Mary.
